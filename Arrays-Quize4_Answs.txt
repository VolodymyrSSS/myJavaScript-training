Task 1
const arr = new Array(3).map(item => item * 2);
console.log(arr);

Answer: [<empty> x 3]

Task 2
const array = [{name:'JS'}, '2', 'Hello'];
delete array[1];
console.log(array.length); 

/* delete operator will delete the element from the array,
leaving a empty slot in place of deleted element. In 
order to delete element prefer to use pop, slice or splice.*/
Answer: 3

Task 3
const val = [2, 4, 8]
const valTwo = val.map(function(el) {
   return el ** 2;
})
console.log(valTwo);

/* "**" operator returns the result of raising the first 
operand to the power of the second operand. It is 
equivalent to "Math.pow()", except it also accepts
"BigInts" as operands */
