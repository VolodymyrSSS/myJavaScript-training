Task 1
const x = y = {};
y.name = 'JS';

console.log(x);
console.log(y)

/* "x" and "y" both are assigned to same object. In fact,
we copied the reference to the same object. Therefore, 
changes in one object will lead to changes in another z
object. If we break down above code, then we get 
something like this: 
const y = {};
const x = y;
Hence in the console "{name:’JS’}" will be printed twice.
One time for "x" and one time for "y" */
Answer: {name:'JS'} {name:'JS'}

Test.showName();

/*the value of this inside a static function is class itself.
When we log this inside static method whole class will 
be logged*/
Answer: class Test {

                              this.lang  = lang;

Task 4
const person = { name: “Lydia” };
Object.defineProperty(person, “age”, {value: 42});
console.log(person.age);
console.log(Object.keys(person));

/*age won’t be included. Because property defined with 
defineProperty are non enumerable by default*/
Answer: 42
Answer: { name: “Lydia” }
===================================

Task 5
const name =  “Noren Red”;
age = 42

console.log(delete name);
console.log(delete age);
console.log(typeof age);

/*when we don't use any declaration before any variable,
it will be treated as a global variable, and will be added
as deletable entity in window object */
Answer: false // delete operator only deletes a key in object
Answer: true
Answer: undefined

Task 6
const foo = {};

const bar = {key: 'bar'};
const baz = {key: 'baz'};
const quux = {key: 'quux'}

foo[bar] = 1; foo = { [object Object]: 1 }
foo[baz] = 2; foo = { [object Object]: 2 }
foo[quux] = 3; foo = { [object Object]: 3 }

console.log(foo[baz]); 

/*  in JavaScript, when you use an object as a key in 
another object, the object is automatically converted to 
a string. This conversion involves calling the "toString" 
method on the object. For plain objects like "{key: 'baz'}", 
the default toString method returns "[object Object]".
Now, let's look at the sequence of operations:
foo[bar] = 1; // foo = { '[object Object]': 1 }
foo[baz] = 2; // foo = { '[object Object]': 2 }
foo[quux] = 3; // foo = { '[object Object]': 3 }
so,  the foo object is:
foo = { '[object Object]': 3 }
When we attempt to access foo[baz], it is equivalent to 
accessing "foo['[object Object]']" because "baz" is an 
object, and it is implicitly converted to the string 
"[object Object]". Therefore, "console.log(foo[baz])" 
prints the value associated with the key '[object Object]'
in the "foo" object, which is "3".
Despite each object (bar, baz, quux) is being used 
as a unique key in the "foo" object and each assignment 
creates a new property in the "foo" object, they are all 
converted to the same string representation, which is 
"[object Object]". Therefore, subsequent assignments 
with different objects as keys overwrite the previous 
values associated with the key "[object Object]" */

===================================

Task 7
const obj= { name: "JS" };
obj.ref = obj;

JSON.stringify(obj);

/* code creates an object "obj" with a property name 
set to the string "JS". Then, it adds a circular reference 
by assigning "obj" to its own property "ref". Finally, it 
attempts to stringify the object using "JSON.stringify(obj)".
However, when trying to stringify an object with 
circular references using "JSON.stringify", it results in an
error. The reason is that "JSON.stringify" cannot handle 
circular references by default. JSON is a data interchange
format, and circular references cannot be represented 
in it.
If you want to stringify an object with circular references,
you need to provide a "replacer" function as the second
argument to "JSON.stringify". For example:
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj, (key, value) => {
  if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
    if (value === obj) {
      return '[Circular Reference]';
    }
  }
  return value;
});
console.log(jsonString);
This code checks for circular references and replaces 
them with the string "[Circular Reference]". If you run 
this modified code, it will stringify the object without 
throwing an error, and you'll see the circular reference 
handled appropriately.

Task 9
const letters = new Set(["a","b","c"]);

const iterator = letters.entries();

}
console.log(text);

/*A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values.
Each value can only occur once in a Set. A Set can 
hold any value of any data type. But Set has no keys.
Method keys() returns an Iterator object containing all 
the values in a Set, the same like values() method. 
Method entries() returns [value,value] pairs instead of 
[key,value] pairs.This makes Sets compatible with Maps.*/

/* First we declare a globally-scoped variable "a" with

globally-scoped if not inside a function), this re-declares
the global "a" and assigns it the value "2". But in the second
if-block, the "let" is a block-scoped, so this creates a new
"a" and it is local only to this block, and log 3 in the
console. After second if-block has finished, the "let a" is no 
longer accessible and last console logs "2" because the global
"var a" was previously re-assigned to "2".*/
